   ## WireFraming

   To begin the project i created a wire frame to give me a guide to how i wanted to use the website. I also selected a palette of five colors to standardize my website. The colors are:
   * #f7fff7
   * #ffe66d
   * #2f3061
   * #343434
   * #6ca6c1
   I used the Coolors website to pick them.
   
   An image depicting my wire framing can be viewed below:

   ## UserStory

   As a user I want a professional profile website that is intuitive to use and responsive to multiple display sizes. It needs to be a showcase of my capabilities as well as a link to my completed web applications. 

   ## Development

   *Research carried out into how good professional profiles should appear

   * Creation of a wire frame to guide how the website should look on creation.

   * Creation of the initial react application

   * Creation of a basic nav bar to allow deploy testing of the site

   * creation of a basic footer

   * creation of pages and initial rough styling of pages as well as populating the content.

   * error debugging, research, content editing and style editing.

   * addition of more dynamic elements to showcase a more personalized and styled website
   
   * more debugging, and research

   * snag checking and final style editing

   * readme file generation

   * This will be a project that will evolve and develop further as I progress in my knowledge and understanding of web development
